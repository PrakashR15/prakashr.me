## Long Story Short

I have tried to build portfolio websites in the past, but I failed ðŸ˜¿

This time, coming back powerful than before ðŸ˜Ž and while in search of a good minimalistic design for my personal blog I found [https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-portfolio-cara)


## Built With
    
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) 
- and deployed to [Netilfy](https://netlify.com/)


## Running Locally

```sh-session
git clone https://github.com/PrakashR15/prakash.me.git
cd prakash.me
```


Then install dependencies and run the development server:
```sh-session
npm install
npm dev
```
