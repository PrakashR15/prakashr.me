I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree in Information Technology and am a self-taught programmer with strong proficiency in Python and Java. My technical foundation is further strengthened by a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms.

I have hands-on experience working with the .NET ecosystem, particularly in ASP.NET and ADO.NET, where I've developed both Razor Pages and MVC applications. I specialize in building full-stack solutions by integrating RESTful APIs, SQL databases, and frontend components. I also implement secure authentication and authorization using JWT tokens, and utilize Swagger UI for testing and documentation.

In addition to web development, I leverage Power BI for data visualization and Power Apps for low-code application development. I also have foundational knowledge of machine learning and have created beginner-friendly ML models as part of my learning journey.

I'm passionate about building scalable and impactful solutions, continuously exploring new technologies to enhance my development skill set.
