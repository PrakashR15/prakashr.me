  I have created a text editor with many features similar to Notepad. It is simple, clean, and user-friendly.
  The text editor allows users to read and write files, and I have also included a feature to change the
  background color of the text area and the text color.

  Developed a predictive model capable of distinguishing between poor connections using a range of
  machine-learning algorithms for classification and regression. This model computes various IP address
  parameters thus resulting in highly accurate outcomes.

  Machine learning can help predict Parkinson's disease in its early stages. Iâ€˜ve made a framework for
  accurately predicting Parkinson's by computing various biological measurements. The framework utilizes
  classification algorithms, and experimental testing has shown its effectiveness.
